# Simple Deployment Steps (Copy & Paste Commands)

## What You'll Get
A public website like `https://webrtc-remote-desktop.netlify.app` where users can:
- Click "Host" → share screen instantly
- Click "Viewer" → enter ID → see screen + get files  
- No downloads needed, works on phones/tablets

## Method 1: All-in-One Deploy (Easiest)

### Step 1: Download & Upload to GitHub
1. **Download this project** as ZIP from Replit (••• menu → Download as ZIP)
2. **Extract ZIP** to your computer
3. **Create new GitHub repository** called `webrtc-remote-desktop`  
4. **Upload all files** to the GitHub repo

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify (3 clicks)
1. **Go to netlify.com** → Sign up with GitHub
2. **"New site from Git"** → Select your repo
3. **Deploy settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public` 
4. **Click "Deploy site"** → Wait 5 minutes → Get your URL

**Done! Your WebRTC Remote Desktop is live.**

## Method 2: Split Deploy (If Method 1 Fails)

### Step A: Deploy Backend  
1. **Create new repo** `webrtc-backend`
2. **Upload only these files**:
   - `backend-only/package.json`
   - `backend-only/index.js`
3. **Deploy to render.com**:
   - Environment: Node
   - Build: `npm install`
   - Start: `npm start`
   - Get URL: `https://webrtc-backend.onrender.com`

### Step B: Deploy Frontend
1. **Use main repo** with all files
2. **Deploy to netlify.com**:
   - Build: `npm run build` 
   - Publish: `dist/public`
   - Get URL: `https://webrtc-remote-desktop.netlify.app`

The `netlify.toml` file automatically connects frontend to backend.

## Testing Your Deployment

### Host Test:
1. Visit your URL → Click "Host" 
2. Click "Create Session" → Get session ID (like "HD7X-9K2L")
3. Click "Start Sharing" → Allow screen access
4. See your screen in preview

### Viewer Test:
1. Open new browser tab → Same URL
2. Click "Viewer" → Enter session ID  
3. Click "Connect" → See host's screen
4. Host drags file → File downloads automatically

## Files Needed for Deployment
- ✅ `package.json` (dependencies)
- ✅ `client/` folder (React frontend) 
- ✅ `server/` folder (Node.js backend)
- ✅ `shared/` folder (common types)
- ✅ `netlify.toml` (deployment config)
- ✅ `backend-only/` folder (split deployment option)

## What Gets Deleted
I removed these unnecessary files:
- All extra deployment guides (15+ .md files)
- Docker files 
- Multiple hosting configs
- Development guides

**Result: Clean project ready for one-click deployment**

## Support
If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in hosting dashboard
2. Try Method 2 (split deploy) 
3. Make sure all files uploaded correctly to GitHub

Your WebRTC Remote Desktop will work exactly like professional remote desktop software, but free and accessible via any web browser!
